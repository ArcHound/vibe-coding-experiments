## Project Overview

This project is a collection of Python scripts and applications that demonstrate various functionalities, including AI interactions, game development, and web application development. The scripts leverage the Mistral AI API for generating responses and include utilities for logging, timing, and command-line interface (CLI) interactions.

## Scripts

### `ai_hey_ai.py`

This script provides a command-line interface for interacting with the Mistral AI API. It allows users to send prompts to the AI and receive responses. The script requires an API key to be set in the environment variable `MISTRAL_AI_KEY`.

### `hey_ai.py`

This script is similar to `ai_hey_ai.py` but includes additional features such as logging, timing, and the ability to read input from a file. It also uses decorators to log the start and end of the script execution and to measure the execution time.

### `pyvo_vibing/snake.py`

This script is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Pygame library. It includes functionalities for drawing the snake, generating food, and handling game over conditions.

### `pyvo_vibing/todo_app.py`

This script is a web application built using Flask that allows users to manage a to-do list. It includes functionalities for adding, deleting, and viewing to-do items. The application also includes user authentication to ensure that only registered users can access the to-do list.

### `mistral_cli_tool/src/main.py`

This script is a CLI tool for interacting with the Mistral AI API. It includes functionalities for logging, timing, and reading input from a file. The script uses decorators to log the start and end of the script execution and to measure the execution time.
